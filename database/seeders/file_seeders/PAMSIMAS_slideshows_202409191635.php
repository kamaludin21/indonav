		"content" => "<h2>MOBILE MAPPING</h2><p>CHCNAV's mobile mapping division enables the digital world by merging and fusing technologies. Ground and airborne mobile mapping systems combine state-of-the-art, high-performance hardware, such as accurate long-range laser scanners, high-resolution HDR panoramic cameras, and advanced GNSS receivers with high-precision IMU. Our drones and mobile mapping platforms are portable and robust, allowing for efficient deployment in the field. In addition, our advanced software algorithms process massive 3D point clouds quickly and efficiently.</p><h2>UNMANNED AERIAL MAPPING</h2><p>CHCNAV's Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are extensively used for photogrammetry, land surveying, 3D mapping, and topographic surveying. Many industries, such as construction, oil and gas, infrastructure, archaeology, mining, forestry, and agriculture, have found CHCNAV's solutions a better alternative to traditional surveying methods. Our autonomous, long-range drones with large payload capacity, combined with scanners and cameras, effectively capture 3D data over large areas in a short period of time.</p>",
