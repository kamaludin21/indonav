Automation plays a crucial role in enhancing precision, reducing labor costs, and increasing worker safety by minimizing the need for direct human interaction with hazardous or repetitive tasks. CHCNAV is at the forefront of this transformation with its new MCNAV 3D excavator guidance system, a state-of-the-art solution that brings advanced technology directly to machine operators on job sites worldwide.<\/strong><\/p><p>The MCNAV system for excavators combines a high-precision GNSS receiver with rugged IMU sensors to provide operators with accurate, real-time guidance on the position of the excavator's tip relative to project design models. The system's integrated cloud solution ensures site managers have access to up-to-date models at every stage of the project, enabling precise excavation to target surfaces. By making project drawings and models readily available to machine operators, the MCNAV system significantly reduces the reliance on traditional survey methods. This enhanced precision boosts productivity and cost efficiency, allowing projects to be completed faster and more economically.<\/p>",

GNSS RTK Networks<\/strong><\/p><p>One of the most widely used technical methods for GNSS RTK service is the establishment of a network of fixed reference stations, also known as Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS). CORS networks, consisting of numerous base stations, synchronize and process GNSS data from multiple satellites in real-time to provide precise and continuous 3D corrections. China, for example, has built more than 6,000 CORS stations, while the United States has built more than 2,000. Germany's satellite positioning service, SAPOS, consists of about 300 permanent GNSS reference stations with an average spacing of about 40 km. Japan, which is prone to geological disasters, has about 1,400 permanent GNSS tracking reference stations with an average density of about 20 km.<\/p>",

In urban planning, GIS data effectively manages urban sprawl, where cities that use GIS for planning can reduce urban development costs by 20%. GIS data is also critical in environmental studies to track land cover and vegetation changes. For example, monitoring deforestation with GIS has improved conservation efforts by 15%.<\/p>",
